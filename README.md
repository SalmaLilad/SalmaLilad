## Hi there ðŸ‘‹




This repository is part of my computer science and engineering learning portfolio.

It contains the source code for my personal website, which showcases my projects, achievements, technical skills, and GitHub profile activity. It also contains repositories of the Machine Learning Projects like Covid 19 and Bias in Police search projects done at the University of Minnesota's Advanced AI and MAchine Learning camp.  I have also included all the games and programs I have written in Java and Python and a few MAchine LEarning projects I have worked on .
